# Open University Course Management System (2004)

This repository documents a legacy academic project I developed in 2004 for the **Open University of Israel**, aimed at helping instructors manage all aspects of course administration and student assessment.

## üß† Purpose

At the time, I was a **teaching coordinator** for a university-level course, and there was no existing integrated solution to manage the growing complexity of:
- Course materials
- Student performance tracking
- Assignment and exam question databases
- Learning outcome analytics

This project was created to **centralize and simplify** course-related activities under a single interface.

## üéØ Key Features

- üìö **Learning Material Management**
  - Organize and structure course units, lessons, and topics
  - Map questions directly to their relevant learning materials

- ‚ùì **Question Bank**
  - Author and categorize questions for:
    - Assignments
    - Exams
  - Tag questions by topic, difficulty, and source
  - Maintain model answers

- üë• **Student Management**
  - Register students
  - Record and view student grades per task

- üìä **Performance Analysis**
  - Calculate student success rates per question
  - Identify weak areas based on question-level statistics
  - Generate insights to improve teaching materials

- üìå **Cross-Referencing System**
  - Link each question directly to relevant learning content
  - Improve transparency and pedagogical alignment

## üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack (2004-era)

> *Note: This system was developed in an era before modern frameworks and cloud solutions.*

- Backend: Likely PHP or ASP Classic (depending on your implementation)
- Database: MySQL or Microsoft Access
- Frontend: HTML, early CSS, minimal JavaScript
- Hosting: Local university server

## üï∞Ô∏è Historical Context

This system was designed **before Moodle** became widely adopted. It served as a practical, tailored tool for local course management needs‚Äîfilling a real gap in the academic tools available at the time.

It supported my work over multiple semesters and was instrumental in streamlining the preparation and analysis of both assignments and exams.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is no longer maintained and is provided **for historical reference only**. The code is not representative of modern software practices but stands as an example of early 2000s educational tech in a resource-limited environment.
