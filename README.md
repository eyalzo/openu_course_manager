# Open University Course Management System (2004)

This repository documents a legacy academic project I developed in **2004** for the **Open University of Israel**. It was designed to support my role as a **teaching coordinator**, offering a complete toolset to manage course materials, assessments, student performance, and learning analytics—long before the adoption of modern LMS platforms.

## 🧠 Purpose

At the time, no system existed to centralize academic course management in a flexible, instructor-oriented way. This web-based tool aimed to:

- Organize and manage course content
- Maintain a structured question and exam bank
- Track student progress and grades
- Analyze success rates across questions and topics
- Link assessment items directly to learning materials

---

## 🧩 Features

- 📚 **Course Content Management**
  - Organize topics, units, and materials
  - Link questions directly to relevant study content

- ❓ **Assessment Authoring**
  - Create and edit questions for assignments (MAMAN) and exams
  - Maintain model answers
  - Tag questions by topic and type

- 👩‍🎓 **Student Tracking**
  - Maintain student records
  - Input and view student grades
  - Track submission history

- 📊 **Analytics**
  - Calculate question-level success rates
  - Identify problematic topics
  - Inform future course revisions and focus areas

- 📎 **Cross-Referencing**
  - Each question is linked back to its source material
  - Enhances pedagogical transparency and alignment

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (2004-era)

This system reflects early 2000s intranet web development—built entirely without frameworks:

### 🖥 Backend
- **Classic ASP (Active Server Pages)** – Server-side scripting with embedded **VBScript**
- **Inline SQL queries** for data operations
- **MS SQL Server**

### 🌐 Frontend
- **HTML 4.01** with dynamic table rendering
- **CSS 2.0** (`Openu.css`) with Tahoma typography and color-coded sections (e.g., Exams, Students, Assignments)
- **No JavaScript frameworks**

### 🗄 Hosting Environment
- Hosted on a **Windows server using IIS**
- Entire application logic is in `.asp` pages
- Deployed internally within the university or on faculty-hosted machines

## 🕰 Historical Context

This system was developed and used before widespread adoption of Moodle or Canvas. It filled a very practical need and helped streamline real course operations over multiple semesters in a resource-constrained academic setting.

While the code does not reflect modern development practices, it provides an honest and functional snapshot of early educational technology built entirely by a teaching coordinator, not a development team.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This codebase is not actively maintained and is provided for **historical reference and inspiration only**. It is monolithic, uses deprecated technologies, and is not suitable for production use without a full rewrite.
